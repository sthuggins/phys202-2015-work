More details will follow. You will work on the problems both in and out of class, so class attendance is mandatory. You must stay until the end of class unless you get specific, explicit permission to leave early.\n",

Other times you will participate in pair programming exercises where you are the *driver* and your partner is the *navigator* and vice versa.  Studies show that this is a very effective way to learn programming.\n",
